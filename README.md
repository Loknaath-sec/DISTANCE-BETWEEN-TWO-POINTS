# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance between two points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Giving values to the point x1 and x2
### Step 2: 
Giving values to the point y1 and y2
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula

### Step 4: 
Calculating the distance using normal method to make the code simple
### Step 5: 
At last, print the distance value
### PROGRAM:
```
#Program to find the distance between two points.

x1,x2=10,4
y1,y2=6,2
dis=(((x2-x1)**2) + ((y2-y1)**2))**0.5
print("{:.2f}".format(dis))
```

### OUTPUT:
![Exp 1c Output](https://github.com/Loknaath-sec/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/145742558/28329e32-c3f9-446a-ba3b-ffd0256bc6cf)


### RESULT:
Thus the python program to find the distance between two points is successfully executed.
